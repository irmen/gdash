/// receives keypresses (controls) from the user and passes it to the game
/// controlling class GameControl.
///
/// The GameRenderer class can be used the following way:
///
/// - Creating an object, and assigning it a CellRenderer, a FontManager, a Screen
///   for the graphics stuff, and a GameControl object to control the game.
/// - The GameRenderer::main_int() function is to be called regurarly, and passed
///   the number of milliseconds elapsed and the user controls.
///
/// The object will then control the game and also draw it. And that's all.
/// Showing the story, scrolling the cave, drawing the status bar, enabling and
/// disabling game pause and everything is handled inside.
