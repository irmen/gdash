/**
 * The GameControl class controls the flow of a game: iterating the cave,
 * loading the caves, adding score, managing number of lives etc.
 * It loads a cave from the caveset, passes movement keypresses
 * to the cave iterate routine, controls uncover and cover animations,
 * saves replays, manages highscore.
 *
 * While it is not the responsibility of this class to draw the cave to
 * the screen, it manages two maps; one map (gfx_buffer) contains the cell
 * indexes, which are essentially the cave, and the other one (covered)
 * is a map of booleans which show which cell is covered and which is not
 * (after loading and before a new cave). These maps are in the GameControl
 * class so it can easily manage them when loading a cave.
 *
 * The GameControl class has members which store the cave number, the pointer
 * to the currently played cave and so on. When playing a game, a new
 * GameControl object is created, and it is given a caveset with a start cave
 * number, or a rendered cave with or without a replay, or a stored cave
 * to test from the editor.
 *
 * The object controls rendereding the caves if needed, and also has a gfx_buffer
 * structure, which is a map with the same size that of the cave, and stores
 * the pixbuf indexes of the elements. It also controls recording replays.
 * Manages counting lives, manages bonus scores.
 *
 * To run the whole process, the main_int() function has to be called regurarly.
 * Usually it is called at 25hz or 50hz, depending on user interface settings.
 * Its first parameter is a milliseconds value, in which the caller tells the
 * GameControl, how many milliseconds have passed since the last call (40ms or
 * 20ms, respectively). The object then decides what to do - it may load the
 * cave, it may iterate the cave, it may count bonus points. The return value
 * of this function has information valuable to the caller; for example, loading
 * the cave is signaled (new cave size, new cave colors), also it is signaled
 * when the status bars have to be updated.
 *
 * Internally the GameControl has a state counter, which starts from its lowest value
 * (LOAD_CAVE), and is or is not incremented by the main_int() call. The
 * life cycle of a singe cave is as follows:
 *  - LOAD_CAVE: to load the cave from the caveset (for replays, tests, nothing)
 *  - SHOW_STORY: showing the story of the cave (only for games)
 *  - (SHOW_STORY_WAIT: waiting for the user to press fire)
 *  - (UNCOVER_START: the first frame of the uncover animation)
 *  - UNCOVER: uncovering the cave (70 frames total)
 *  - (UNCOVER_ALL: last frame of uncover animation)
 *  - CAVE_RUNNING: play.
 *  - CHECK_BONUS_TIME: when the cave is finished, bonus time is added to the points,
 *      depending on remaining cave time.
 *  - WAIT_BEFORE_COVER: a 4s wait before covering the cave, after counting bonus
 *      points.
 *  - COVER_START: first frame of covering animation (8 frames total)
 *  - COVER_ALL: last frame of covering animation
